# Knowledge Competition

Quiz game with questions about computers and software.


## Screenshots

- When the program opens, I put a start button so that the contestant can play the game.

- The user tries to progress by answering all the questions and cannot move on to another question without skipping any question.

- When the competitor comes to the last question, the continue button changes to finish. When you press the end button, the number of correct and incorrect will be displayed as a message. Here I used the MessageBox method.

- When the competitor sees the number of correct and wrong he has made, the "Start Again" button comes up so that he can start the competition again, and when he clicks this button, the competition starts again.
